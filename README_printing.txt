If you would like to print any of the lecture materials or would just like
a PDF that you can annotate as you review it, you should open the .Rmd
file in RStudio and then click on the "knit" icon to knit it to a HTML
file in your working directory. Then open the HTML file in Google Chrome
(other browsers do not work well) and choose print from the menu. Make
sure to select landscape mode and then send it to a physical printer or 
save it to a PDF on your hard disk.
